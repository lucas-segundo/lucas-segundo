I am a Fullstack Developer with over 3 years of experience in the IT industry. Since 2020, I have been working on fullstack projects using Typescript and implementing test-driven development (TDD) techniques, design patterns, software architecture, and cloud system deployment. While most of my repositories are private due to company policies, I do have a few public projects that I work on my free time. Check them out below:

#### ðŸ“Œ<a href="https://github.com/lucas-segundo/nuancias">Nuancias</a>
A project developed using Next.js (React.js framework) that serves as a publishing platform. I built it using TDD, Jest, Typescript, and Clean Architecture, and the data is sourced from a Graphql API (Strapi CMS).
 
#### ðŸ“Œ<a href="https://github.com/lucas-segundo/funny-bank-api">Hero API</a>
A project developed with Nest.js that is API for hero creation like rpg video game. I am currently working on it, applying TDD, Typescript, and Clean Architecture.

#### ðŸ“Œ<a href="https://github.com/lucas-segundo/praia-bonita">Praia Bonita</a>
A project developed using pure HTML and CSS. The main goal of the project was to build a website as a team, to gain hands-on experience with Github tools, and learn how to collaborate. The website is quite simple, serving mainly as a practice in collaboration.
